    Like any principle, YAGNI shouldn't be rigidly applied in every situation.
    There are times when anticipating near-future needs makes sense:

    - Well-Known Requirements: If you know with high certainty a feature is coming soon, building some
                               basic support upfront might be wise.

    - Performance-Critical Areas: Sometimes, a less-than-optimal but more general solution is necessary
                                  initially to ensure performance targets are met.
