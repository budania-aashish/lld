    The DRY principle is a guideline, not a hard-and-fast rule.

    There are situations where it might not be the best approach:

    Premature Abstraction:   Trying to apply DRY too early in the development process might lead to over-engineering.
                             If requirements are likely to change, you might abstract code that ends up getting discarded
                             or significantly reworked.

    Performance-critical code:   In some cases, duplicating code can be faster than calling a reusable function,
                                 especially if the function has a high overhead or is not inlined.

    Sacrificing Readability:  If the duplicated code is very simple and easy to understand, it might be better to leave
                             it as is, rather than creating a complex abstraction.

    One-time usage:   If a piece of code is only used once, it might not be worth extracting into a reusable function.

    Legacy code or technical debt: In cases where you're working with legacy code or technical debt, it might be more
                                   practical to duplicate code temporarily, rather than trying to refactor the entire
                                   system.

    Debugging and testing: In some cases, duplicating code can make it easier to debug and test,
                           as it allows for more isolation and control.
