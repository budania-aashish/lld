    Now that we understand the benefits of the DRY principle,
    let's explore some practical ways to apply it in your software development projects.

    - Identify Repetitive Code: Identify areas in your codebase where you have repeated code.
                                Look for patterns, similar logic, or functionality that appears in multiple places.

    - Extract Common Functionality: Extract the common functionality into reusable components,
                                    such as functions, classes, or modules.

    - Use Inheritance and Composition: By creating a hierarchy of classes or composing objects together,
                                      we can avoid duplicating code and promote code reuse.

    - Leverage Libraries & Frameworks: Instead of reinventing the wheel, leverage libraries and frameworks
                                       to avoid writing repetitive code. However, be cautious not to overuse
                                       external dependencies, as they can introduce complexity and maintenance overhead.

    - Refactor Regularly: Applying the DRY principle is an ongoing process.
                          As your codebase evolves, it's important to regularly review and refactor your code
                          to eliminate any new instances of duplication.
