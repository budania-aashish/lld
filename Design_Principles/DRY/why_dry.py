    Why DRY is important:

    - Reduced Code Duplication: By avoiding repeated code, you reduce the overall size of your codebase,
                                making it easier to understand and maintain.

    - Improved Code Reusability: DRY code is more modular and flexible, allowing you to reuse functionality
                                 across your application.

    - Easier Bug Fixing: With a single, authoritative representation of code, you can fix bugs in one place,
                         rather than searching for multiple instances of the same code.

    - Improved Consistency: When you have duplicated code, it's easy for inconsistencies to creep in. By
                            centralizing the logic in a single location, you ensure that the behavior remains
                            consistent across the entire application.

    - Faster Development: By leveraging existing code, you can speed up your development process and focus on
                          new features and functionality.
