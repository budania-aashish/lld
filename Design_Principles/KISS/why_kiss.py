"""
    The KISS principle is important because it helps developers avoid the pitfalls of over-engineering
    and premature optimization.

    - Improved Readability: Simple code is easier to read and understand, making it more accessible to other
                            developers who may need to work with the codebase in the future.

    - Reduced Complexity: By keeping code simple, developers can reduce the overall complexity of the software,
                          making it easier to maintain and debug.

    - Faster Development: Simple code can be written and tested more quickly, allowing developers to iterate
                          and deliver features faster.

    - Enhanced Reliability: Simple code is less likely to contain bugs or unexpected behavior, leading to more
                            reliable software.

    - Increased Flexibility: Simple code is often more modular and flexible, making it easier to adapt and extend
                            as requirements change.
