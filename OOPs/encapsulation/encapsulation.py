"""
    one of the four OOPs principle in Encapsulation.

    Encapsulation is a practice of hiding the data. This means bundling of the variables
    and methods and keep them together to get operated into a single unit (a class)
    while restricting the direct access to the internal details.

    Encapsulation in python achieved using
    1. Access Modifiers
    2. Getters & Setters
    3. Data Hiding

    Encapsulation helps in data protection, modularity, and maintainability of the code.

    It basically restricts the access to some of the components of an object, which helps
    protect data integrity and prevents unintended modifications.

    Key Benefits -
    - Data Hiding - prevents direct access to sensitive data
    - Increased Security - controls how data is getting used, accessed and modified
    - Improved Code Maintainability - Allows changes without affecting other part of the code
    - Better Modularity - organizes the code into logical components
