"""
    Polymorphism - poly means many, polymorphism means many forms, one of 4 OOPs principle
    It allows single interface to be used by multiple objects, enabling flexibility, scalability and code re-use.

    Polymorphism can be divided into two main parts -
    1. Compile time polymorphism - python handles it differently
    2. Run time polymorphism - method overriding & duck typing

    Polymorphism means many forms, it requires function/method/object to behave differently based on the given context.

    Polymorphism means dynamic method resolution & method flexibility making applications easier to maintain & extend.


    Key Benefits -
    1. Code Reusability - write one interface and use it for many types
    2. Scalability - Add new functionalities with minimal code changes
    3. Maintainability - Reduce code complexity & improve code clarity
