    5. Abstract Class:

    An  abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated


    (you can't create objects directly from it).

    It serves as a blueprint for other classes (subclasses) that inherit from it.

    An abstract class in UML is represented with the class name in italics  and the
    keyword «abstract» above the class name.


    Abstract methods within the class are also typically shown in italics.
