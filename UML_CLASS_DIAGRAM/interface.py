    4. Interfaces:

    An interface defines a contract for classes that implement it.
    It specifies a set of methods that the implementing classes must provide.

    Methods in interfaces are abstract by nature, so they are usually shown
    without any implementation details.

    Interfaces are depicted as a class rectangle with the keyword «interface»
